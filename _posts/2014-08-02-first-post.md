title: Why are you here?
---

For some strange reason, you have stumbled into this dark corner of the web. Well what you are seeing is the beginning of something great (or not). This website is being built with my recent efforts to learn programming and my desire to unleash the stream of conciousness. Sit tight, more to come. 

I would like to take a moment to post the resources I am using and give credit where credit is due (and a chance to play with markdown):

- This is being hosted with [Github](http://www.github.com)
- Blog webframe by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
- Learning resources from [Codeacademy](http://www.codecademy.com) and [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com)
- The story of [Aaron Swartz](http://www.takepart.com/internets-own-boy)
